🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year of purchase, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history.
A Linear Regression model is used as the primary approach, with proper preprocessing, encoding, and evaluation to ensure model correctness and interpretability.

🎯 Problem Statement
Given historical car data, can we build a regression model that accurately estimates the selling price of a car?
This is a classic supervised regression problem with real-world relevance in the automobile resale market.
